# Image-Steganography
This Image Steganography project focuses on embedding hidden information, such as text , within an image file in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye. The technique utilizes the least significant bits (LSB) of pixel values to encode the secret data, ensuring that the image remains visually unchanged while securely storing hidden messages. The project demonstrates the principles of data concealment, encryption, and secure communication, providing a practical application for privacy and digital security.
